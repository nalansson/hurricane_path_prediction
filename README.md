# Description

Project for Data Science course. 

## Known Issues. 
Due to problems with the latitute/longitude encoding, the model has a high accuracy predicting the latitude, but low accuracy predicting longitude. This can be fixed by includeing a second model that inverts the latitude/longitude selection in model building. May update in the future.
